           MADAME JOURDAIN: What jargon is this?
           <br>
           MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Non tener honta, questa star l'ultima affronta.
            <br>
           MADAME JOURDAIN: What in the world is all that? 
           <br> 
           MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: (Dancing and singing) Hou la ba, Ba la chou, ba la ba, ba la da.
           <br>
           MADAME JOURDAIN: Alas! Oh Lord, my husband has gone mad.

           MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: (Leaving) Peace, insolent woman! Show respect to the Monsieur Mamamouchi.

           MADAME JOURDAIN: Has he lost his mind? I must hurry to stop him from going out. Ah! Ah! This is the last straw! I see nothing but shame on all sides.(She leaves)
